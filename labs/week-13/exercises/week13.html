  <h2 class="header">Keyboard Events</h2>

  <div class="content-areas">
    Try taking a look at the source code in the index.js which is wired to this document with a script tag at the bottom of a page. Try pressing a key on your keyboard, you'll be alerted of the key you pressed.

    Also, try a combination key using the ctrlKey. You'll also notice a key combination will get alerted. Javascript's 'keyup' and 'keydown' events can be used to capture user input when a key is pressed and released.

  <h2 class="header">Inline Event Handlers - Don't use these</h2>
  <div class="content-areas">
    For a start, it is not a good idea to mix up your HTML and your JavaScript, as it becomes hard to parse â€” keeping your JavaScript all in one place is better; if it is in a separate file you can apply it to multiple HTML documents.

    Even in a single file, inline event handlers are not a good idea. One button is OK, but what if you had 100 buttons? You'd have to add 100 attributes to the file; it would very quickly turn into a maintenance nightmare. Let's add a button below with an inline event called bgChange. The background should change on click. 
  </div>

  <div id="button-background">
    <button onclick="bgChange()">Change Background</button>
