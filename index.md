> :squirrel: An announcement coming up or a deadline do? Get notified through GitHub about the occurence. For questions please contact me at jmorenstein@georgebrown.ca - I'm able to schedule one-on-one time outside of class or set up ad-hoc reviews, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

 *the :squirrel: will always have some useful tips for you to read. So whenever you see one, make sure you take a look at what the squirrel has to say.*

 For all course weeks coming up, you'll find your material here. If you can't make it to class, you'll have the material you need to complete the weeks exercise when time permits. The idea is to complete the labs and exercises. If there is something that you're having troubles grasping, just let me know. If you feel like you're falling behind, also let me know so we can ensure that your weekly labs are accounted for.
